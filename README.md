# Uncommon HTML Error: Incorrect Div Nesting in Table Cell

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error involving incorrect nesting of a &lt;div&gt; element within a table cell (&lt;td&gt;).  While browsers may render this without outright errors, it's semantically incorrect and can lead to unexpected behavior or accessibility problems.

The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect code, and `bugSolution.html` demonstrates the corrected version.  The solution uses appropriate inline elements or restructures the table to avoid the problematic nesting.

This is a great example of how seemingly minor HTML issues can create problems down the line. Always check for proper semantic use of HTML elements.
